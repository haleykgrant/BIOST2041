We can do lots of operations in the console and have R print out the answer for us.\nFor example, if we want to check what 2+3 is, we can run the code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen you run the code above, it prints out the number 5. That’s great, but maybe I don’t want to have to type that every time I want to use those numbers. This is where R objects come in. For example, maybe I have a variable that I want to call x that will hold the number 2 and a different variable called y that will hold the number 3. I can do this with the following code\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: = vs &lt;-\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you might see the operator &lt;- (for example x &lt;- 2) instead of the equals sign (=). This is an artifact of earlier versions of R when you had to use &lt;- to assign values to objects; both work now and = is shorter so I used it here :)\n\n\n\nNote that when you run this code, nothing happens! Or at least, that’s what it looks like. If we were running this in RStudio, we would see in the upper right quadrant under the “Environment” tab that we now have two objects, x and y, that have the values 2 and 3 respectively. To see this here, we can print out the values:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nCool! Now that x and y are placeholders for the numbers 2 and 3, we can use them just like numbers. For example, we can add them together, multiply them, divide, subtract, etc. If we want to save the value of x + y for later use, we can do that too!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."

    "text": "Types of Data\nIn the example above, we were using numeric variables. However, there are many different types of data in R. Some of the main types of data we will use are\n\nnumeric: numbers\ncharacter: character strings/words\nfactor: categorical variables that store data in levels\nlogical: binary TRUE/FALSE\nNA: stand-in for missing values\n\n\nNumeric\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nCharacter\nThis is a number so we can use the same types of functions as we used above on the object x_numeric (adding, subtracting, etc.).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is a character. Even though it looks like a number, the quotation marks tell R that we don’t want to treat this as the number 5. For example, maybe this is and identifier for hospital number 5 in a study. In this case, we probably don’t want to do typical calculations as if this was the number 5.\nExercise: See what happens when you try to multiply x_character by 2.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nError messages\nOh no! You should see the following error message:\n\nError: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\nThis is how R is telling you that you’re trying to apply a function that requires a number to an object that isn’t a number. R gives helpful error messages like this when you try to run code that doesn’t work. Sometimes the language R uses is hard to understand, but you can always ask me or a TA what the error means, or search the error on Google!\nExercise: If you change x_character to x_numeric in the code above, you should see it works just fine!\n\n\nFactor\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere we can see that x_factor is a factor variable. It may not be obvious why this is useful yet, but it should hopefully become clear as the semester goes on. Factors are essentially a way that you can pick the order that categorical variable levels are presented and give the variables nice names for things like printing in a plot.\n\n\nLogical\nR has another type of data called “logical” values. These are binary TRUE/FALSE (can also abbreviate with T/F) that let you know if a statement is true or false. This can be really useful when we want to filter data. For example, if we want to filter data to everyone over the age of 50, we can check the logical variables to check if age is greater than or equal to 50.\nIn the example below we’ll make a new variable to tell us if x_numeric from above is equal to the number 5.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExercise: Try changing the value in the code above to check if x_numeric is equal to the number 4 to see how the value would change.\n\n\nMissing Values\nR has a special way of denoting missing values. In R, these show up as NA values. For example, if you have a data set with 100 individuals’ height, weight, and age, if you weren’t able to get the values measured for some of the individuals, those values should show up as NA values to indicate that they are missing.\nNote: this is different from “NA” the character. R will change the color of NA when you type it in your code to show that this is a special kind of variable.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExercise: Try multiplying the x_missing variable by 2 and see what happens.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nGenerally any kind of functions applied to missing values return another NA value unless the function has a special way of handling missing values."

    "title": "Tutorial 2: R Objects, Functions, and Packages",
    "section": "R Packages",
    "text": "R Packages\n\nWhat is an R package\nR comes with a lot of great built-in, ready-to-use functions, but there are probably lots of other functions that we might want to use that don’t come built in to R. You can write your own functions in R if you want, but usually someone else has already written the kind of function you want to use. This is where R packages come in.\nThe following description of R packages comes from this R Basics Tutorial from R-Ladies Sydney.\n\nA package is a bundle of code that a generous person has written, tested, and then given away. Most of the time packages are designed to solve a specific problem, so they to pull together functions related to a particular data science problem (e.g., data wrangling, visualisation, inference). Anyone can write a package, and you can get packages from lots of different places, but for beginners the best thing to do is get packages from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It’s easier than any of the alternatives, and people tend to wait until their package is stable before submitting it to CRAN, so you’re less likely to run into problems. You can find a list of all the packages on CRAN here.\n\n\n\nHow to install R packages\n\n\n\nTest your knowledge\n\n\nLoading Packages\nJust because you installed an R package once, doesn’t mean you want to use it for every task you do in R. Because of this, R will automatically load a small set of default packages when you launch a new session, but you’ll need to tell it if you want to use any additional packages. To load a library that isn’t loaded by default, we use\n\nlibrary(package_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: loading packages\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother reason we don’t automatically load all of the packages we’ve ever installed on our computer is because sometimes different packages have functions that are named the same thing (this is because R is open-source)! When this happens, it can be frustrating to try to figure out which version of the function R is using and requires extra code to tell R which version of the function you want to use. To avoid this it is best practice to only load the packages you currently need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading uninstalled packages\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that you have to install an R package once before you ever use it. After you’ve installed it once, you don’t need to re-install it, you just need to load it into your session to have access to its contents.\nIf you ever run a line of code like this:\n\nlibrary(mypackage)\n\nand get an error message like this:\n\nError in library(mypackage) : there is no package called ‘mypackage’\n\nthis means you are trying to load a package you haven’t installed yet and you need to run install.packages(\"mypackage\") once first.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse package\nThe R tidyverse package is a very useful suite of packages that make data manipulation and visualization clean and efficient. To see all of the packages included in the tidyverse package run the following code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should produce an error when you first try to run it. Can you tell why?\n\n\n\n\n\nError message\nOh no! We got another error message. You should see the following error:\n\nError: could not find function “tidyverse_packages”\n\nThis is R’s way of telling you that you’re trying to use a function that it doesn’t have access to. The tidyverse_packages() function comes from the tidyverse package. Even if you have the tidyverse installed on your computer, that doesn’t mean you have it loaded for R to use.\nTo give ourselves access to the functions from the tidyverse package, let’s add the line of code library(tidyverse) before the line of code in the chunk above. That should fix the problem.\nExercise: Add the line of code library(tidyverse) before the line of code in the chunk above and try rerunning the code chunk.\n\n\nThe pipe operator from the tidyverse\nOne of the unique functions provided by the tidyverse is called the “pipe operator.” The pipe operator looks like this: %&gt;%. The pipe operator is a way of stringing together a bunch of functions and the purpose is to make your code easier to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: %&gt;% vs |&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent updates to R also let you use |&gt; as the pipe operator, but I’m old so I still use %&gt;% :)\n\n\n\nTo see an example of this, consider the following task:\nWe want to know how many unique values are contained in the vector x_vector.\nTo do this, we can start by having R grab the unique values in x_vector using unique(x_vector).This will give us a vector of the unique values in x_vector. Then, we can print the length of the output of unique(x_vector) to get the number of unique values.\nTo do this, we could define a new intermediate vector called x_unique to hold the vector of unique values in x_vector, or we can just use multiple functions simulatneously by nesting the parentheses:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice how the order of operations was:\n\nStart with your input x_vector\nDetermine the unique values of x_vector\nCalculate length of unique(x_vector)\n\nHowever, reading left-to-right we see the last step first. This can get particularly confusing when we want to apply multiple sequential functions to the same object in R. Imagine we had wanted to do 3 more functions! This would have read as:\n\nfunction3(function2(function1(length(unique(x_vector)))))\n\nThat’s a lot of parentheses and it’s hard to even figure out where the operation starts!\nTo fix this, we can use the pipe operator:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSee how the output is the same but the order of operations is much clearer in this example? It’s clear that we start with the object x_vector, which we then extract just the unique values from, then finally calculate the length of just the vector of unique values.\nIn the example above with an extra 3 functions at the end, this would read as:\n\nx_vector %&gt;% unique() %&gt;% length() %&gt;% function1() %&gt;% function2()  %&gt;% function3()\n\nStill long, but a lot easier to follow (at least I think so)!"

    "text": "Files on your local computer\nWhen you are working in R on your local computer and you want to import a data file into your R session for an analysis, you will need to tell R where it can find the data file. This is why I suggested creating a ‘data’ folder in your class folder. If you save all of the data files for this class in that folder, you can always use the same general syntax for telling R where your file is.\nFor this tutorial, we are working on the web, so R doesn’t have access to the local files on your device. I have included all of the data files we will be using in this tutorial on a webpage that we can access online. You may need to change this code slightly to when running code for your assignments in this class to work with your computer’s file structure.\n\nChecking your working directory\nOne good idea when you start working on a new analysis is to make sure you know where within your computer’s file structure you are working so you can figure out how to access various files.\nWe can use the function getwd() to have R print out the path to the directory (folder) we are currently working in.\nTry running the code in this block:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou should see the output is\n\n“/home/web_user”\n\nThis is because we are working in R on the web. This is telling us that we are in a subdirectory of the “home” directory called “web_user”. That is, “web_user” is a directory (folder) inside the larger directory (folder) called “home”. You read file paths from left to right\nTry running this in your Console in RStudio on your computer, and you should see a file path that corresponds to the file structure on your computer.\n\n\nList files in working directory\nTo check the files that are present in our current directory, we can use the function list.files() to list out all of the files that are stored in the directory where we are currently working.\nTry running the code in this block:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe output should look something like this:\n\n[1] “Rplots.pdf” “cdc.samp.csv” “census.rda” “dds.xlsx”\n\nThis tells us that there are 4 files that we have access to in this directory:\n\na file called “cdc.samp.csv”\na file called “census.rda”\na file called “dds.xlsx”\n\nThere are the data files that we will be working with in this tutorial."

    "text": "Importing Data\n\nReading in a csv file\nTo read in a csv file to R, we use the function read.csv(). There is a similar function in the tidyverse package called read_csv() that you could also use. We’ll go ahead and use the tidyverse version.\nThe syntax to use this function is:\n\nname_for_data = read_csv(\"path_to_data\")\n\n\nHere name_for_data is any name you choose to call the data frame. It can be helpful to give it a name that is relevant to the data, but you can call it whatever you want (with some limits, for example the name can’t start with a number).\n\"path_to_data\" is the file path that will tell R where to look for your data. You will see more examples of this in class, but for this example, the files are in our working directory so we don’t need any long file paths to navigate through different directories.\n\nLet’s try reading in the “cdc.samp.csv” file and give the dataframe the name cdc.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint (if you get an error)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get the following error:\n\nError: could not find function “read_csv”\n\nyou forgot to load the tidyverse package!\nAdd a line of code above your read_csv() line to load the tidyverse (library(tidyverse)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."

    "text": "Getting Set Up\n\nFiles on your local computer\nWhen you are working in R on your local computer and you want to import a data file into your R session for an analysis, you will need to tell R where it can find the data file. This is why I suggested creating a ‘data’ folder in your class folder. If you save all of the data files for this class in that folder, you can always use the same general syntax for telling R where your file is.\nFor this tutorial, we are working on the web, so R doesn’t have access to the local files on your device. I have included all of the data files we will be using in this tutorial on a webpage that we can access online. You may need to change this code slightly to when running code for your assignments in this class to work with your computer’s file structure.\n\n\nChecking your working directory\nOne good idea when you start working on a new analysis is to make sure you know where within your computer’s file structure you are working so you can figure out how to access various files.\nWe can use the function getwd() to have R print out the path to the directory (folder) we are currently working in.\nTry running the code in this block:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou should see the output is\n\n“/home/web_user”\n\nThis is because we are working in R on the web. This is telling us that we are in a sub-directory of the “home” directory called “web_user”. That is, “web_user” is a directory (folder) inside the larger directory (folder) called “home”. You read file paths from left to right\nTry running this in your Console in RStudio on your computer, and you should see a file path that corresponds to the file structure on your computer.\n\n\nList files in working directory\nTo check the files that are present in our current directory, we can use the function list.files() to list out all of the files that are stored in the directory where we are currently working.\nTry running the code in this block:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe output should look something like this:\n\n[1] “cdc.samp.csv” “census.rda” “dds.xlsx”\n\nThis tells us that there are 4 files that we have access to in this directory:\n\na file called “cdc.samp.csv”\na file called “census.rda”\na file called “dds.xlsx”\n\nThere are the data files that we will be working with in this tutorial."

    "text": "View your data\nGreat! We’ve now read our first data file into R. But how do we know if it worked?\n\nThe head() function\nIn RStudio, you should be able to see a new object in your ‘Environment’ tab in the upper-right quadrant of your screen when you import a new data set. Since we’re working on the web, we’ll go ahead and use a different function to take a look at the top few rows of the dataset. The function that will allow us to do this is head() that shows us the top few entries of a data frame, vector, or list.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint (if you get an error)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get the following error:\n\nError: object ‘cdc’ not found\n\nthis is R’s way of telling you that you don’t currently have an object loaded into your environment called ‘cdc’.\nWhen you see an error like this, you should make sure the code used to import the data worked properly and that you don’t have any spelling errors (R is case sensitive so you have to be very careful to spell things exactly correctly).\nMake sure you were able to successfully run the code above with the read_csv() function without any errors before running this code block.\n\n\n\nAwesome! Here we see the top 6 rows of the cdc dataframe. There are 9 columns:  genhlth, exerany, hlthplan, smoke100, height, weight, wtdesire, age, gender.\n\n\nThe skim() function\nAnother way we can start to take a look at the data is to use a function from the R package skmir. The function is called skim and gives us a nice overview of the contents included in our data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis function breaks our columns into groups based on the type of variable they are. Here we see that  genhlth and  gender are characters and the rest are being treated as numeric (even though it looks like we may have a few other binary variables that were coded as 0/1—more on this later).\nThe columns for categorical variables are:\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nn_missing\n\n\nthe number of rows with missing value (NA) in the corresponding columns\n\n\n\n\ncomplete_rate\n\n\nproportion of rows that are not missing (not NAs)\n\n\n\n\nmin\n\n\nthe minimum character length of values in the column\n\n\n\n\nmax\n\n\nthe maximum character length of values in the column\n\n\n\n\nempty\n\n\nthe number of empty characters in the column\n\n\n\n\nn_unique\n\n\nthe number of unique values in the column\n\n\n\n\nwhitespace\n\n\nthe number of rows containing only white space in the column\n\n\n\nThe columns for numeric variables are:\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nn_missing\n\n\nthe number of rows with missing value (NA) in the corresponding columns\n\n\n\n\ncomplete_rate\n\n\nproportion of rows that are not missing (not NAs)\n\n\n\n\nmean\n\n\nthe mean (average) value of the non-missing values in the column\n\n\n\n\nsd\n\n\nthe standard deviation of the non-missing values in the column\n\n\n\n\np0\n\n\nthe minimum value observed in the column\n\n\n\n\np25\n\n\nthe 25th percentile of values observed in the column\n\n\n\n\np50\n\n\nthe median (50th percentile) of values observed in the column\n\n\n\n\np75\n\n\nthe 75th percentile of values observed in the column\n\n\n\n\np100\n\n\nthe maximum value observed in the column\n\n\n\n\nhist\n\n\na histogram showing the shape of the distribution of values in the column"
