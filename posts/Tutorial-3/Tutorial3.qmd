## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn about working with data in R. In particular, this tutorial will cover...

-   Reading in data from different file types
-   Data frame structure in R
-   Updating and making new variables
-   Filtering data

## Getting Set Up

### Files on your local computer

When you are working in R on your local computer and you want to import a data file into your R session for an analysis, you will need to tell R where it can find the data file. This is why I suggested creating a 'data' folder in your class folder. If you save all of the data files for this class in that folder, you can always use the same general syntax for telling R where your file is.

For this tutorial, we are working on the web, so R doesn't have access to the local files on your device. I have included all of the data files we will be using in this tutorial on a webpage that we can access online. You may need to change this code slightly to when running code for your assignments in this class to work with your computer's file structure.

### Checking your working directory

One good idea when you start working on a new analysis is to make sure you know where within your computer's file structure you are working so you can figure out how to access various files.

We can use the function `getwd()` to have R print out the path to the directory (folder) we are currently working in.

Try running the code in this block:

```{webr-r}
# check your current working directory
# there shouldn't be anything between the two parentheses here
getwd()

```


You should see the output is 

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[\left\"/home/web_user\right\"]{style="font-weight: 500;"}
:::

This is because we are working in R on the web. This is telling us that we are in a sub-directory of the "home" directory called "web_user". That is, "web_user" is a directory (folder) inside the larger directory (folder) called "home". You read file paths from left to right

Try running this in your Console in RStudio on your computer, and you should see a file path that corresponds to the file structure on your computer.

### List files in working directory

To check the files that are present in our current directory, we can use the function `list.files()` to list out all of the files that are stored in the directory where we are currently working. 

Try running the code in this block:

```{webr-r}
# print files in working directory
list.files()
```

The output should look something like this:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[[1] "cdc.samp.csv" "census.rda"   "dds.xlsx"]{style="font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500;"}
:::
  
This tells us that there are 4 files that we have access to in this directory:

- a file called "cdc.samp.csv"
- a file called "census.rda"
- a file called "dds.xlsx"

There are the data files that we will be working with in this tutorial.

## Types of files

The main types of files that we will work with in this class are:

<style>
  table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
  }
  th, td {
    border: 1px solid #dddddd;
    text-align: left;
    padding: 8px;
  }
  th {
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
  }
</style>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>File Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>File Extension</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CSV files </td>
    <td> This stands for "comma separated value". These are files that have rows with entries separated by commas to indicate the different columns</td>
    <td>.csv</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Excel files</td>
    <td>Files in Excel workbook/sheet format</td>
    <td>.xls or .xlsx</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>R data files</td>
    <td>Files with saved R objects</td>
    <td>.RData or .rda</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The three files we will read in today have the following names:

-   "cdc.samp.csv" : a csv file with demographic data from the cdc
-   "dds.xlsx" : an excel file with data from the department of disability services in California
-   "census.rda": an R data file with data from the US census



## Importing Data


### Reading in a csv file

To read in a csv file to R, we use the function `read.csv()`. There is a similar function in the `tidyverse` package called `read_csv()` that you could also use. We'll go ahead and use the tidyverse version.

The syntax to use this function is:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
`name_for_data = read_csv("path_to_data")`
:::

-   Here `name_for_data` is any name you choose to call the data frame. It can be helpful to give it a name that is relevant to the data, but you can call it whatever you want (with some limits, for example the name can't start with a number). 

-   `"path_to_data"` is the file path that will tell R where to look for your data. You will see more examples of this in class, but for this example, the files are in our working directory so we don't need any long file paths to navigate through different directories. 

::: {.callout-warning }
## Assigning a name

__Warning:__ Naming the object is very important!

If you forget to choose a name for your dataframe, R will read in the data and print it, but it won't save it as an object. If you just use `read_csv()` without the `name_for_data =` part, you won't be able to manipulate or analyze the data
:::

::: {.callout-warning }
## Duplicate names

__Another warning:__ If you read in two datasets and accidentally give them the same name, *the one you run second will overwrite the first one*! Sometimes this is useful; for example, if you just want to make a change to a dataset (more on this later). But be careful and when in doubt, give new dataframes different names!

:::

Let's try reading in the "cdc.samp.csv" file and give the dataframe the name `cdc`.

```{webr-r}
# read in the data file "cdc.samp.csv"
cdc = read_csv("cdc.samp.csv")
```


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Hint (if you get an error)

If you get the following error:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[Error: could not find function "read_csv"]{style="color: #db4133; font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500;"}
:::

you forgot to load the tidyverse package!

Add a line of code above your read_csv() line to load the tidyverse (`library(tidyverse)`).
:::



::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Answer

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false

# load tidyverse package first
library(tidyverse)

# read in the data file "cdc.samp.csv"
cdc = read_csv("cdc.samp.csv")
```
:::


### Viewing your data

Great! We've now read our first data file into R. But how do we know if it worked?

We're going to take a brief detour to talk about taking a first look at your data before we move on to importing data from other files types.

#### The head() function

In RStudio, you should be able to see a new object in your 'Environment' tab in the upper-right quadrant of your screen when you import a new data set. Since we're working on the web, we'll go ahead and use a different function to take a look at the top few rows of the dataset. The function that will allow us to do this is `head()` that shows us the top few entries of a data frame, vector, or list.

```{webr-r}
# show top few rows of the data set `cdc`
head(cdc)

```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Hint (if you get an error)

If you get the following error:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[Error: object 'cdc' not found]{style="color: #db4133; font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500;"}
:::

this is R's way of telling you that you don't currently have an object loaded into your environment called 'cdc'. 

When you see an error like this, you should make sure the code used to import the data worked properly and that you don't have any spelling errors (R is case sensitive so you have to be very careful to spell things exactly correctly).

Make sure you were able to successfully run the code above with the `read_csv()` function without any errors before running this code block.
:::

Awesome! Here we see the top 6 rows of the `cdc` dataframe. There are 9 columns: <span style="font-family: Monaco;"> genhlth, exerany, hlthplan, smoke100, height, weight, wtdesire, age, gender.</span>

#### The skim() function

Another way we can start to take a look at the data is to use a function from the R package `skmir`. The function is called `skim` and gives us a nice overview of the contents included in our data.

```{webr-r}
#| warning: false
#| context: interactive
#| autorun: true
# load skimr library
library(skimr)
```

```{webr-r}
# use the skim() function on the cdc data
skim(cdc)

```

This function breaks our columns into groups based on the type of variable they are. Here we see that <span style="font-family: Monaco;"> genhlth</span> and  <span style="font-family: Monaco;"> gender</span> are characters and the rest are being treated as numeric (even though it looks like we may have a few other binary variables that were coded as 0/1---more on this later). The summary information gives us a snapshot of the contents of each column in the data. More information about the specific sections of the output can be found below.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" }
## Understanding `skim()` output
The columns for categorical variables are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>n_missing</td>
    <td>the number of rows with missing value (NA) in the corresponding columns</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>complete_rate</td>
    <td>proportion of rows that are not missing (not NAs)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>min</td>
    <td>the minimum character length of values in the column</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>max</td>
    <td>the maximum character length of values in the column</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>empty</td>
    <td>the number of empty characters in the column</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>n_unique</td>
    <td>the number of unique values in the column</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>whitespace</td>
    <td>the number of rows containing only white space in the column</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The columns for numeric variables are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>n_missing</td>
    <td>the number of rows with missing value (NA) in the corresponding columns</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>complete_rate</td>
    <td>proportion of rows that are not missing (not NAs)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mean</td>
    <td>the mean (average) value of the non-missing values in the column</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sd</td>
    <td>the standard deviation of the non-missing values in the column</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>p0</td>
    <td>the minimum value observed in the column</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>p25</td>
    <td>the 25th percentile of values observed in the column</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>p50</td>
    <td>the median (50th percentile) of values observed in the column</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>p75</td>
    <td>the 75th percentile of values observed in the column</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>p100</td>
    <td>the maximum value observed in the column</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>hist</td>
    <td>a histogram showing the shape of the distribution of values in the column</td>
  </tr>
</table>
:::

Back to reading in data from various file types...


### Reading in an Excel file

We've successfully read in a csv file, but what if we get a different file type? For example, a lot of people store data in Excel. Can R handle those files? Yep! But we're going to need to use a new package called the `readxl` package.


::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Reminder: Installing `readxl`
Remember that if you don't have this package installed on your local computer, you'll need to install it before you can load and use it. I've already installed it here, but remember that to install the package you can just run `install.packages("readxl")` in your console in R Studio.
:::

Once we have the `readxl` package loaded, the syntax is very similar to `read_csv()` from above. There are a few different functions that could work from this package, but the most generic one is `read_excel()`. The syntax is: 


::: {style="text-align: center;"}
`name_for_data = read_excel("path_to_data")`
:::

Let's try it using our 'dds.xlsx' file!

```{webr-r}
# load the readxl package 
library(readxl)

# save the data contained in dds.xlsx under the name `dds`
dds = read_excel("dds.xlsx")

# make sure it worked by looking at the first few rows
head(dds)
```

Awesome! We can see that there are 6 columns in this data set: <span style="font-family: Monaco;"> id, age.cohort, age, gender, expenditure, ethnicity.</span>

Once you have the `readxl` package, importing Excel files works just like reading in csv files!

### Importing R data files

There is one other type of file that we will use from time to time in this class. This is a special kind of file called an R data file that saves R objects. __The syntax is slightly different for these kinds of files.__

The syntax for importing an R data file is:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
`load("path_to_data")`
:::

::: {.callout-warning }
## load()

Notice how we didn't include anything on the left side of the `load()` function here. We didn't give the data a name!
:::

The reason we don't assign names to data loaded from an R data file is because __these objects already come with a name__. Since these are R objects that were saved specifically in a file format that R understands, they keep the name that they were given when they were first created in R. So how do we know what the name is? We can add an extra argument to this function called `verbose`. The syntax will become:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
`load("path_to_data", verbose = TRUE)`
:::

This tells R to print out the name of the data object once it is loaded so we know what to call it.

Let's see an example of this using our 'census.rda' file.

```{webr-r}
# load in the data
# add verbose = TRUE so the object name gets printed

load("census.rda", verbose = TRUE)

```

We can see the message:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
[Loading objects: \n census]{style="font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500;"}
:::
